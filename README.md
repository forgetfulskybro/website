# Personal Website
Shows off my projects, music I'm listening to, and games I recently played.

## Stealing
If you happen to take code from here it would be nice if you put in your README that it came from here. If not that is also fine as I can't do anything against people taking it. All I ask is that you don't take the whole site as making your own site will be much better for you than just taking one and changing everything to suit you. Sure it's easier to do that but it looks a lot better when you make it yourself. 

## Contribution
If you want to add something or edit my code because it looks like shit (it most likely will if you happen to take a look into it), then just send a pull request. Make sure to add what you edited and made sure it works on your system first as that would be helpful for me when I want to test it out myself.
